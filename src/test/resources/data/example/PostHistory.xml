When you get to ~500 questions and there's a bigger sampling of these, then it's _much_ easier to identify factors that make something a solid fit here rather than somewhere else. " />

The alternative is not generating inbox notifications for child meta suggested edits, which (unfortunately, for the most part) means they'd go unseen or approved in a queue by others, and _might_ not be something the author would have approved as suggested. Meta is a town hall; that's why you need privileges to edit directly on the main site to edit here, one of the chief reasons anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Killed by slow, and do you even meta?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On sites that _don't_ have very active child meta sites, participation is _much_ lower. Turning on work queues here would just mean creating a backlog that moderators would feel obliged to clean out from time to time. It just wouldn't work as you intend it to work. Showing them in the _main_ site queue alleviates that to some extent, but that's shown to everyone regardless of meta participation. Queues where you accomplish small units of work are already a big ask on the main site, I really don't want to mix them. As meta sites tend to take on their own culture over time, I don't want non-participants here reviewing suggested edits because the system asked them to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###I am a mean, horrible person.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But with all of that said, turning our engine sort of upside down for discussion here on meta worked well enough. But, it's missing stuff. There aren't any polls, people can get down-voted for asking for support, curating is sort of second class and opportunistic and using it as a bug tracker could be made much more ideal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I _hope_ to take on a project this year that takes a serious look at child meta sites, and how they could perhaps diverge a bit in terms of features from the main sites. This is something I'd like to see possible, just ... better, not bolted on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm declining it as proposed, but that doesn't make it a bad idea. In fact it's a good one (heck, I up-voted it), but in need of some groundwork that I _really_ want to do." />

Keep in mind that the welcome isn't for us, it's for the new user. Even if the same welcome message has been posted plenty of times and you're tired of it, it's the first time *they've* seen it - that's why they're being welcomed! So it doesn't seem nearly so robotic to them as to you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, while making them feel welcomed is half the goal, letting them know about the ground rules is really important too. A lot of people expect discussion forums, and are really confused by the way StackExchange sites work the first time they visit. They post not-really-answers, they take downvotes personally, and so on. Pointing them to the tour/help at the first opportunity is an attempt to avoid this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in my mind, the canned messages are fine. I might tweak the one you quoted a bit, but there's nothing wrong with something along those lines. If I wanted to go beyond that, I'd simply to throw in a specific comment as well - something very simple that I liked about their post, or a suggestion for improving it. But that's not always too easy, and I don't think there's anything wrong with just using the template.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, if you want more variety, why not just welcome them yourself?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The moderators don't own the site. Their primary job is to do the things that no one else can. This early in a beta, there's a little more in that category since there are fewer high-reputation users. But welcoming a new user? All you need to be able to do is comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you want to contribute some variety, go for it. A variety of *users* doing the welcoming is perhaps even more meaningful than a variety of messages: it demonstrates that the site is a community site, not one kept carefully under the control of a few moderators. Just keep in mind *why* you're doing it: to make them feel welcome, yes, but also to help them learn how the site works so they can make good contributions." />

Let's focus instead about what you're really asking, and what type of answer you're looking for. It seems that there's quite a bit of interest in the topic of [Kopi Luwak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_Luwak), because there are several questions about it and much discussion. I think there's a lot of room for interesting Q&amp;A related to this topic!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fundamentally, [what's your question or what are you trying to solve](http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask)? From your initial question, it sounds like...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* you have never tried Kopi Luwak;&#xD;&#xA;* you don't know how it tastes,&#xD;&#xA;* you are unable or unwilling to try it;&#xD;&#xA;* you are looking for an alternative.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are any of those a more fundamental question that you have?  **How about changing the question to, &quot;What does Kopi Luwak taste like?&quot;** Then you can also ask in the body of the question, or infer from the answer, &quot;What other coffees taste like it?&quot;  Though similar in concept, I think &quot;how does it taste&quot; comes across better.  What do you think? I'd be happy to re-articulate the question with you, or un-lock it if you change it around.  For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;**What does Kopi Luwak taste like?**&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;I have never had the opportunity to try Kopi Luwak, but I'd like to know how it tastes. How is does the taste differ from more traditionally processed coffee from the same region? Are there other coffees that have similar tasting notes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;Or something like that. That said, [this answer says Kopi Luwak is delicious](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/141/262), and has some descriptions, but there's probably room for another question on the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Another question might be something more like &quot;*Why* does Kopi Luwak taste different?&quot; For example, what is it about the Kopi Luwak digestion process that changes the beans? What happens to the beans during digestion (e.g., protein digestion)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There might also be room for a question about [Black Ivory Coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ivory_coffee), which is apparently coffee digestively &quot;processed&quot; in a similar way by rescued elephants." />

I especially liked [this answer from hardmath](http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1131/262) about how [Math.SE](http://math.stackexchange.com) handles some of those &quot;canonical&quot; topics.(Aside: [His particular example](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/39802/why-does-123-cdots-frac112) is fasinating and blew my mind. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think there's value in letting good answers to such topics &quot;happen organically,&quot; even though that's somewhat less satisfying in certain ways than getting some good, fundamental answer to some good, fundamental question committed into the annals of the Internet(s). That said, I saw some confusion (partly my own) about a topic, so I wrote a self-Q/A about http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean My goal there was to clear up some terms that I didn't understand and that were being used somewhat inconsistently or imprecisely. Especially in those cases, I'm certainly in favor of penning a good Q/A.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, I think having some &quot;softball&quot; questions every once in a while, even if duplicate, is healthy. If a new user to the site gets hooked by giving a solid answer to a question, that's a great &quot;gateway&quot; to this community. Having fundamental topics that are &quot;still open&quot; might be a good hook for a new user.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another take on this is that some questions that are on-topic for the site might be already answered well other places. For example, if I search for how to make a cup of coffee in an auto-drip coffeemaker, I think I'd find a very large number of answers that are very adequate... therefore, they don't need to be &quot;asked&quot; here as such. That said, I'd be totally happy if someone earnestly asked something like that and got an earnest, helpful answer from this community. I hope we will be so lucky as to be &quot;the&quot; coffee reference site at some point in the future! :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

It was posted and had ***zero votes, zero answers, and zero other comments*** when I suggested that it get migrated over to here at Coffee. I got push-back from my comments and ended up chatting with her (SA mod) in Chat. Her perspective was very by-the-book (i.e., the aforementioned meta) that says &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;    We only migrate questions because they are off-topic on the original site. It is perfectly possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is not a reason to migrate it elsewhere. ***As a general rule***, if someone asks a question here, and it's on-topic here, it should stay here.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(My emphasis added). I was hoping, due to context, that they'd be willing to migrate this very on-point Coffee question to Coffee.SE -- nope. I disagree *in this particular case*, but she's a mod there and I'll respect her adherence to policy and conviction!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, migration should be &quot;uncommon&quot;. To OP's point, I think the question in question should remain here. The Coffeemaker question, I think, should have been migrated here. This may sound relativist, but we're young and can use on-point questions such as that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My opinion: If you, as an OP...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* are posting a question that is on-topic at multiple sites, and&#xD;&#xA;* are aware of both sites, and &#xD;&#xA;* choose to post it at site A instead of other sites (as @starsplusplus did in this case),&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;then I maintain that *it should not be migrated*. If any of these assumptions are missing (e.g., OP likely doesn't know about other more-on-topic site) then it's up for discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The `hoc_age` doctrine: &quot;If the question *involves coffee*, ask it at [***Coffee.SE***](http://coffee.stackexchange.com)!&quot;" />

You're supposed to be out there on the Internet to find a ***new*** community (or at least a new scope of questions) that were *not* being well served before. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where is this untapped audience? Or questions that cannot be asked elsewhere? Finding them is your job now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you read my article about why (sometimes) we split off subjects from existing sites &amp;mdash; [**Apparently this is a duplicate**](http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/a/17846/5) &amp;mdash; I list a few of the criteria we would be looking for:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We would be looking for things like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. An ecosystem of questions that are not already in scope on the existing site(s)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. A show of numbers that clearly demonstrates the parent site is failing to attract that  &#xD;&#xA;audience *&amp;larr; this is a big one*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. A weighty argument that a *new* community exists that does not identify themselves as part of the larger subject (see [Ubuntu versus Unix](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/unix-and-ubuntu-why-both/))&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. Scope Failure &amp;mdash; Maybe we got it wrong the first time. A large subject can cover a huge number of topics. But if the site is not competitive in any *particular* subject, it [may be time for a breakup](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/pruning-season/) (&quot;sum of the parts&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5. etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think (1) is a tough sell. I haven't seen many of those *&quot;largely off-topic for a cooking site&quot;* questions yet. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondly, if you're trying to divert users/questions from another SE site, that disproves (2) by definition. That would have ended the creation of this site before it even got started. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That leaves (3) and (4) &amp;mdash; a community that *loves* their coffee, but it would never occur to them to try our Cooking site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I don't believe soliciting and diverting users from *other* SE sites is the way to go. The best way to bring in that new audience is to **find *OTHER* coffee communities and show them what Stack Exchange is about.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's why we created this site." />

The polls may well work out for some amount of time right now - as you say, the site's smaller. But in the long run I'd predict you'll find yourself gradually changing your mind and starting to close them. Old polls still attract new answers. Old polls get used as examples to justify new broad/subjective questions. And new ones get less and less manageable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Math.SE probably isn't really a great example in favor of this idea; if you look through their big-list tag, you'll find plenty where the voting/sorting has broken down because there are just too many answers, and the early popular ones win out. You'll also find a decent number that are on hold/closed. From what I can tell, the ones that are working out are the ones that aren't actually terribly big lists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So... it's certainly something you can do, and it's possible it'd attract some users. But if the site keeps growing, you'll almost inevitably find that you have to do a good amount of work to revise your policies and clean up later. Maybe that's a tradeoff worth making, but it's also not a bad idea to try to find other ways to broaden your scope that aren't polls. Maybe you can make product reviews work, or even narrowly scoped recommendations." />

If there's nothing qualitatively missing, then I think you've got your answer. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I looked around on Meta to see if this question has been asked before, and I didn't immediately find one. Here's a few with related topics:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [From Meta.SE, on encouraging or rushing people to accept answers](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/191755/can-we-stop-rushing-people-to-accept-an-answer)&#xD;&#xA;* [From Meta.Math, on people who don't accept answers](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/13286/people-who-do-not-accept-answers-suggestion-for-dealing-with-this)&#xD;&#xA;* [From Meta.SE, a very basic newcomer's primer on the effects in general of accepting an answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Extremes on both ends (immediately accepting first response, or never accepting a response) probably have impacts. I am guilty of &quot;not accepting&quot; sometimes, though I am usually good about up-voting any/all answers to a question of mine that have value. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Accepting is the right thing to do if you have received an answer that answers your question. It gives you some extra points, the answer-er some extra points, and it helps draw other people to the answer that you (the asker) found most helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other considerations: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **You can always change your mind!** If a new answer comes in that better answers your question, you can accept a different answer.&#xD;&#xA;* Questions without an ***accepted*** answer will show up in **the &quot;unanswered questions&quot; list**, even those that have (one or more) answers.

However, in some cases the first answer is obviously inadequate, or as the case is with this one, I see that the question could have many more than one good answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I find myself avoiding answered questions primarily due to the notion that I'll offend someone with my response by insinuating the incompleteness or inaccuracy of his answer.

(× however many kinds of beans identified in the above question)&#xD;&#xA;- What are all the factors that contribute to differences between beans?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first sub-question by itself would be also be ridiculously broad. In the answers to the question, different types of beans were categorised according to **regional differences** (such as African, Asia-Pacific, but could be broken down even more into individual countries), **species and sub-species of coffee** (such as Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Bourbon, Typica, Maragogype), and **preparation methods** (such as washing, dry-processing).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second sub-question isn't actually a single question, but many questions. For example, &quot;What are the characteristics of Arabica beans?&quot; would attract quite different answers to &quot;What are the characteristics of dry-processed beans?&quot; Even then, 'characteristics' would have to be defined: shape? flavour? texture? smell? shelf-life? caffeine content?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The third sub-question is also too broad, even if it was split into an individual question, because everything that happens to a coffee bean contributes to its differences: location, handling, sunlight availability, nutrients in the soil, water availability, picking, transportation, roasting method, length of roasting... the list goes on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A key indicator of the question being too broad is that the current highest-voted answer doesn't even attempt to address all these points, ending with:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And a lot of other factors... :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've already flagged this for moderator review but nothing seems to have happened... yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: what does the community think?

If a new user to the site gets hooked by giving a solid answer to a question, that's a great &quot;gateway&quot; to this community. Having fundamental topics that are &quot;still open&quot; might be a good hook for a new user.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another take on this is that some questions that are on-topic for the site might be already answered well other places. For example, if I search for how to make a cup of coffee in an auto-drip coffeemaker, I think I'd find a very large number of answers that are very adequate... therefore, they don't need to be &quot;asked&quot; here as such.

Why? Was it because I provided a specific recipe instead of asking for a general approach? In my opinion my question could have been asked on either site, but **I posted it here because I specifically wanted *coffee* expertise** about how to prepare the coffee to use in the recipe, and how to determine what type to use.

I got push-back from my comments and ended up chatting with her (SA mod) in Chat. Her perspective was very by-the-book (i.e., the aforementioned meta) that says &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;    We only migrate questions because they are off-topic on the original site. It is perfectly possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is not a reason to migrate it elsewhere. ***As a general rule***, if someone asks a question here, and it's on-topic here, it should stay here.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(My emphasis added).

This discourages editing on [meta], which may be a fine thing, but I think it also reduces *participation*, which is probably not a good thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's an apparently-stalled (years-old) [feature request](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/129033/262760) to expand edit features in [meta]s. Does anyone else want this?  Mods / high-rep users, do you *not* want this? Is this reasonable for beta-sites, like this one (as of this writing)? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suspect this too much of an uphill battle, with losing cost-benefit, of marginal value.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Why? Was it because I provided a specific recipe instead of asking for a general approach? In my opinion my question could have been asked on either site, but **I posted it here because I specifically wanted *coffee* expertise** about how to prepare the coffee to use in the recipe, and how to determine what type to use.

(× however many kinds of beans identified in the above question)&#xD;&#xA;- What are all the factors that contribute to differences between beans?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first sub-question by itself would be also be ridiculously broad. In the answers to the question, different types of beans were categorised according to **regional differences** (such as African, Asia-Pacific, but could be broken down even more into individual countries), **species and sub-species of coffee** (such as Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Bourbon, Typica, Maragogype), and **preparation methods** (such as washing, dry-processing).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second sub-question isn't actually a single question, but many questions. For example, &quot;What are the characteristics of Arabica beans?&quot; would attract quite different answers to &quot;What are the characteristics of dry-processed beans?&quot; Even then, 'characteristics' would have to be defined: shape? flavour? texture? smell? shelf-life? caffeine content?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The third sub-question is also too broad, even if it was split into an individual question, because everything that happens to a coffee bean contributes to its differences: location, handling, sunlight availability, nutrients in the soil, water availability, picking, transportation, roasting method, length of roasting... the list goes on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A key indicator of the question being too broad is that the current highest-voted answer doesn't even attempt to address all these points, ending with:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And a lot of other factors... :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've already flagged this for moderator review but nothing seems to have happened... yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: what does the community think?

We have options to basically approve, delete or skip this post.  I was hoping I might get some advice on how other reviewers handle this type of question.  Should we be very critical of the posts to maintain high quality, or be lenient and let a post like the answer above slide and maybe throw a comment in to the poster to try and get some improvement in answer quality?  The user is brand new, and has posted what essentially comes down to an advertisement, but in such a way that it actually kind of sort of answers the question (in a terrible way).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the one hand we want to maintain content integrity, but on the other hand, we don't want to be so brutal in our reviewing that it turns users away from the site.
